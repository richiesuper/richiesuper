# richiesuper

- Greetings!

I'm richiesuper, a dev from Indonesia. While I don't always make new projects,
I do make them when I have some free time and the mood is right.

- What am I interested in?

I'm interested in website programming and software programming. I also like to
learn about other interesting things, like politics and economy.

- What am I currently learning?

I'm currently learning C++, although I also have experience with C.
I also know Python (albeit not so expert), because it was my first programming language ever.

- What am I looking to collab on?

I don't have any plans for collaboration for the time being.

- How can you reach me?

You can reach me at richie9963@gmail.com
